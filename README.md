# INFO411-Assignment-2
A repository for University of Otago's INFO411 Assignment 2.
## Contributors
[Jacques Klavs](https://github.com/jacquesklavss) and [Daniel Pienaar](https://github.com/Daniel-P95) contributed to this repository.
## Overview of the assignment
The assignment required us to explore a well-known data set: the Heart Disease Data Set available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/45/heart+disease). It is a data set of 13 explanatory features (numerical and categorical) and 1 target variable: the presence of heart disease. The researchers gathered data for this set across several locations around the world, including Switzerland and Hungary. At the time of writing this 'README.md' file, the data set had 64 citations and 269 786 views.

The exploration of this data took the form of exploratory data analysis (EDA), some basic imputation, machine learning model development, and the development of an interactive dashboard to explore some interesting figures. The language that was used in completing this assignment was [Julia](https://julialang.org/), using the interactive [Pluto](https://plutojl.org/) environment.

This assignment was the end-of-paper submission for the INFO411 - Machine Learning and Data Mining - paper hosted by the University of Otago (New Zealand) as part of the Master of Business Data Science programme.
## Guide for this repository
This repository has 5 folders, which hopefully have been named adequately enough for ease of navigation: 
- The 'Dashboards' folder contains a file displaying dashboards of several of our notable figures.
- The 'EDA' folder contains a file describing the data set and discusses some interesting statistical features and figures.
- The 'Imputation' folder contains some basic imputation of the data set.
- The 'Source data' folder contains the download of the data set directly from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- The 'Modelling' folder contains the machine learning models developed.

For reference, the original assignment instructions ('INFO411 - Assignment 2 instructions.pdf') has been included. A '.docx' report file has also been included, which was also a requirement of this assignment. It presents a summary of key findings from each of the aspects of the assignment.
For any questions or comments, please get in touch.

Thank you,

Jacques and Daniel
